thesis-test-images
==================

Contains the 32 sets of test images used for testing our four hand recognition algorithms. 

Each algorithm was tested with 8 sets of images: 1 for each gesture and 1 set of negatives:

Global Histogram Matching (Open, Fist, Thumb, Two, Three, Four, Duck, and Negatives)

Region of Interest Histogram Matching (Open, Fist, Thumb, Two, Three, Four, Duck, and Negatives)

Global Contour Matching (Open, Fist, Thumb, Two, Three, Four, Duck, and Negatives)

Square Bounded Contour Matching (Open, Fist, Thumb, Two, Three, Four, Duck, and Negatives)


Each set consists of about 25-35 images.
