Notes:

White background does not work; not enough contrast
tried 119 threshold value, still didn't work - no good
threshold value

Performance seems heavily dependent on small
fluctuations in lighting; the paper was bent up a bit
on first test of Contours Matching II and required a 
threshold of 115 due to the extra light reflection. But
for the first data set in Contours Matching II, paper had
become bent down, so a threshold of 80 was used in the second
run to improve accuracy.
